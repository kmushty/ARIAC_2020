   Determine Gaps 
      1st approach
      -->Subscribing to frames for shelves to note the positions(tf )  --> get shelf positions
      -->compare shelf positions and note adjacent positions. For shelves greater than some threshold there is a gap

      ---> verification
      --->compare gap coordintaes with gazebo

   
   #akwasi
   Determine human location- for only specific location


   #shantam
   --placing break sensor  --place on all the shelves 
   -- create all subscribers for all break beams

   #Kaushik
   -- detect when a break beam is triggered
   -- preset locations for different configurations
