# Wiki | ARIAC 2019 Vs. ARIAC 2020

## Environment
* We have made some significant changes in the environment this year. Those changes include:
  * Stationary and moving shelves which can contain parts.
    * Shelves can be moved between runs, thus creating a new configuration of the floor.
  * Locations of bins, conveyor belt, and AGVS have changed since ARIAC 2019.

## Robot
* The robot used in ARIAC 2020 is a dual-arm gantry robot mounted on ceiling rails.
* The arms are the same UR10 arms used in ARIAC 2019.

## Parts
 * We reused the same parts from previous ARIAC but now each part comes in 3 colors (red, green, blue).
 * Participants will now need to grasp parts based on their type AND color (e.g., blue gasket part or red piston rod part).

## Moving Obstacles
 * We can now have up to 2 moving obstacles in the environment.

 ## Sensors/Cameras
  * We have increased the range of the logical cameras. A logical camera can cover 4 bins (compared to 1 bin previously).
