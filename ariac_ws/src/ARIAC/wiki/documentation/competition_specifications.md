# Wiki | Documentation | Competition Specifications #
This page outlines the specifications for [the Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition](https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation) (ARIAC) 2020.

The following terminology is frequently used in this document:
 is highlighted in red

1. **Order**: A set of shipments.
1. **Product**: One element of an order.
1. **Tray**: A surface that hold products.
1. **Kit**: A tray and set of products that make up an order.


# 1. Competition Scenarios

* ARIAC requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around order fulfillment. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the Work Environment section.

* There are three different test scenarios that all involve moving products from a supply location to a shipping box. The possible supply locations are a set of stationary bins. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Details about the scenarios follow.

1. **Scenario 1: Baseline Kit Building**

    The first scenario is intended as a baseline set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this scenario is to pick specific products and place them on a tray. The robot system will receive an *Order* that details the list of products and their target locations. Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.

2. **Scenario 2: Dropped Product**

    The task for scenario 2 is identical to scenario 1, however one or more products will drop from the robot's gripper. The robot will need to recover after dropping a product and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped product, or fetching a new product.

3. **Scenario 3: In-Process Order Change**

    While the robot is in the middle of assembling a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robot will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.

The competition will consist of 15 trials: 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.

Details of the agility challenges used in these scenarios can be found on the [agility challenge](agility_challenges.md) page.

# 2. Environment

* The simulation environment is a representation of an order fulfillment workcell with a gantry robot, a conveyor belt, product bins, product shelves, AGVs, and trays.

## 2.1. Conveyor Belt

* The conveyor belt is a **0.65 m wide**, **9 m long** plane that transports objects across the work environment.
* The following properties impact teams' interaction with the belt:
 1. Products will travel down the belt at a fixed speed of **0.2 m/s**.
 1. Teams can control the conveyor belt during development, but not during the final competition.
 1. There is a limited supply of products on the belt, and any products placed on the belt are automatically removed if they reach the end of the belt. Products will not be replaced once removed.

## 2.2. Product Bins
* There are 16 product bins that may be used for building kits.
* Products in these bins will not be replaced once used.
* All products in a particular storage bin are of the same type and have the same orientation.
* The product bins are shallow boxes measuring **0.6 x 0.6 m**.

## 2.3. Product Shelves
* Besides bins and the conveyor belt, we now have the possibility to spawn parts on shelves.

* Each shelf has two levels (top and bottom shelves):
   * Top and bottom shelves contain ghost parts. Those parts are only there for aesthetic, meaning **they are not graspable**.
   * Product shelves come in 3 different flavors (`base`, `collar`, and `pipe`). They all have the same dimensions. Only the type of ghost parts for those shelves are different. The three types of shelves used in ARIAC 2020 are displayed below.
   <img src="../figures/product_shelves.png" alt="alt text" width="900" class="center">

   * When parts are spawn on a shelf, they will always be spawn on the bottom shelf, never on the top shelf.

   <img src="../figures/shelves_stationary_dynamic.png" alt="alt text" width="900" class="center" style="zoom: 150%;" >

   * There are exactly 11 shelves in the environment.
      * The figure above shows *only two examples* of shelves' configurations in the environment  (there are many more combinations). 
      * Moving shelves are moved between runs and not during runs.
      * Shelves 1, 2, 5, 8, and 11 **will never move** between runs (stationary shelves) while shelves 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 can move between runs (moving shelves).
      * **Very Important**: Parts will never be placed on shelves 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10. These shelves are used to only change the configuration of the floor, thus allowing participants to do path planning.
      * Moving shelves will only be displaced in their own row (Rows 1, 2, and 3).
         * Shelves 3 and 4 will only move in Row 1.
         * Shelves 6 and 7 will only move in Row 2.
         * Shelves 9 and 10 will only move in Row 3.
      * To access parts on bottom shelves, the robot needs to navigate between the shelves as it cannot go over them.
         * **Each row has exactly one gap**, generated by moving shelves. For instance, Figure 1.1, Row 1 has a gap between shelf 4 and shelf 5. In Figure 1.2, Row 1 has a gap between shelf 3 and shelf 4.
         * Also note that gaps are not necessarily between shelves. Figure 1.2 shows a gap before shelf 9.
         * During testing, you can specify where to put this gap for each row. For instance, you can edit [**sample.yaml**](https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC/blob/master/nist_gear/config/sample.yaml) as shown below. To create a gap in a row you only need to use 0 instead of a shelf name. In the code below there will be a gap between the shelf `base` and `collar` in Row 1.    
```yaml
shelf_layout:
   row_1: ['base',0,'collar','collar'] #shelves: 3, 4, 5
   row_2: ['pipe',0,'base','collar']   #shelves: 6, 7, 8
   row_3: [0,'pipe','base','collar'] #shelves: 9, 10, 11
```


â€‹        
## 2.4. Parts
* ARIAC 2020 has 4 part types (gasket, piston rod, gear, and pulley).
* Each part type comes in 3 colors (see figure below).
* **Instead of the usual 4 part types** we had in the previous competitions, this year we have **12 part types**
  * 3 red gasket parts, 
  * 3 piston rod parts,
  * 3 gear parts, and
  * 3 pulley parts.

## 2.5. Trays
* Orders must be placed on a tray at one of two AGVs.
* Teams programmatically signal the AGVs when a kit is ready to be delivered.
* Each tray is shallow and measures **0.5 x 0.7 m**



# 4. Moving Obstacles

- ARIAC 2020 introduces moving obstacles (**MOs**).

- **MOs** can be set in any of the four aisles as shown in the figure below and will go back and forth in the aisles where they are spawned.

- The ARIAC environment may contain 0, 1, or 2 **MOs**.

- Specifications for **MOs** are as follows:

  - Each **MO** will have a predetermined travel time (from one end of the aisle to the other end).
  - Each **MO** will have a predetermined wait time which starts when the **MO** reaches the end of the aisle.
  - **Neither the travel time nor the wait time are communicated to participants**.

- The config file `sample_obstacles.yaml` contains examples of moving obstacles.

# 3. Robot #
* This year, competitors will have to control a 15 DoF gantry robot to complete the challenges. The robot is depicted in the figure below and consists of:
    * 1 linear actuator which controls the base of the torso on the small rail.
      * The base moves at a velocity of **4m/s** and is within the range **y=[-7, 7]**
    * 1 linear actuator which allows the small rail to move along the two long rails.
      * The small rail moves at a velocity of **4m/s** and is within the range **x=[-14.5, 5.25]**
    * 1 rotatory torso which rotates 360 degrees around the base z-axis.
    * Two 6 DoF UR10 arms attached to the torso.
      * Each arm's base has a fixed joint to the torso.
    * A tray is attached at one of the extremities of the torso. Participants may put parts in this tray while fetching other parts in the environment.
    * The end of each arm is equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner (on/off) and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.

# 4. Sensors #


* Teams can place sensors around the environment in static locations. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score.
* Available sensors are:

   1. **Break beam**: reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.
   1. **Laser scanner**: provides an array of distances to a sensed object.
   1. **Depth camera**: provides a point cloud of sensed distances.
   1. **Cognex logical camera**: provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of
   view. **Note**: The range of the logical camera has been increased to cover 4 bins at a time (instead of 1 bin previously). With this new range, 2 logical cameras should be sufficient to cover the surface of a shelf.
   1. **Proximity sensor** outputs how far an object is from the sensor.
   1. **RGB-D camera**: provides point cloud data (similar to the depth camera) along image data.

* Sensors can be placed in any free space in the workcell, they do not need to be mounted so that they are touching the conveyor belt/support frame of the storage bin.
* Sensors must be used in a realistic manner and must not exploit any simulation technicalities such as the logical camera seeing through obstructions.
* For the details about how to configure the sensor locations, see the [configuration specifications](configuration_spec.md).
* More details on each sensor can be found on the [sensor Interface](../tutorials/sensor_interface.md) page.

# 5. Order #

- An order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete.
- Each order will specify the list of products to be put in the shipment, including the type, color, and position/orientation of each product.
- An order may require being delivered to a particular AGV.
- For more details see the [product specification](frame_specifications.md) page.


# 6. Faulty products #

- Throughout the workcell are quality control sensors that detect faulty products.
- If faulty products are detected while teams are fulfilling orders, those products should be removed from the tray and replaced with another product of the same type.
- Faulty products will not count for any points when the shipment is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-products bonus if left in trays (see Scoring, below).

# 7. Scoring #

Performance scores will be automatically calculated for each trial as a combination of performance metrics and costs.
These will be combined with scores from judges to determine the final winners.
See the [scoring metrics](scoring.md) page for more details.

# 8. Competition process #

Each trial will consist of the following steps:

1. The robot programmatically signals that it is able to begin accepting orders.

1. The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robot.

1. A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.

1. In the case of the Dropped Product testing method, up to three products will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.

1. In the case of the In-Process Order Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.

1. The robot signals programmatically when a kit is complete and ready to be delivered.

1. The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.

For details on how the communication with the competition system is performed during the trial, see the [competition interface](competition_interface_documentation.md) page.

There are no time limits for individual orders, but each trial has a time limit.
This information is not broadcast by the ARIAC server.
For the Finals/Qualifiers, the time limit will be set as a fixed value for all trials, which teams will be advised of in advance.
