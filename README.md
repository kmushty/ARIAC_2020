# Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition(ARIAC):
## Introduction:
ARIAC requires completion of series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around order fulfillment. More information regarding ARIAC can be found [here](https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC/blob/master/wiki/documentation/documentation.md). This repository highlights the completion of agility challenges.
